# Coffee-Sales-Analysis
This project analyzes a coffee sales dataset to uncover sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance. Using Excel and Power BI, the raw dataset was transformed into a dynamic and interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and inconsistencies. Standardized date formats, product categories, and customer details. Handled missing values. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified top-selling coffee products and categories. Analyzed regional sales performance and customer segments. Tracked monthly and yearly sales trends.

Dashboard Development: Built pivot tables and pivot charts in Excel. Designed an interactive dashboard in Power BI with slicers for product, region, and date filtering. Included KPIs such as Total Sales, Top Customers, and Best-Selling Products.

## Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, pivot tables, charts) Power BI (interactive dashboard, data visualization)

## Key Insights:
Seasonal trends significantly influence coffee sales. Certain regions consistently outperform others in terms of volume. Specialty coffee types drive higher revenue compared to standard blends.
